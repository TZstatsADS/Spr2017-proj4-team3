+ Project summary: In this project, we implemented the algorithms from paper1 and paper6 (with C2 constraint) to deal with name disambiguation problem. Both of the papers use unsupervised learning algorithm to cluster publications from each of the authors. We implement the algorithms, design the experiments, evaluate results both between the two algorithms and with each of the algorithm. And finally we come to the conclusion that the overall performance of algorithm in paper 6 is better than that in paper 1 in general, but at the expense of time.
