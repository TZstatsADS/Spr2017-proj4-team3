# Project 4: Who Is Who -- Entity Resolution

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

Paper1_training.rmd and Paper6_training.rmd are used to run the algorithms for all txt files. We have already saved the results of them into RData files in "output". You do not have to run them because it may take a few hours. Final_Report.rmd is the rmd file of our final report. It uses the results from the two training.rmd.
